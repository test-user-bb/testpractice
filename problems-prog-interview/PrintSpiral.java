		//now we start to process

			//firstly index will be telling us row/column we are looking
			if(index%2==0)//columns, horizontal scan
				thisLength = nums[0].length - (index/2);//think why this
			else//rows, vertical scan
				thisLength = nums.length - (index/2) - 1;//this is another place that notice first time to print the vertical column there is one element printed out already
			
			//before going we need check if this length is zero if so we quit
			if(thisLength==0) return;

			//otherwise, we now need decide direction, again as index is keep increasing, we need judging its value compared to 4 directions
			int xIncre = 0;
			int yIncre = 0;//they are important to know which direction to go
			switch(index%4)//assume order is right down left up and continue
			{
				case 0: yIncre = 1; break;//think we proceed to right, so only y index needs incrementing
				case 1: xIncre = 1; break;//down
				case 2: yIncre = -1; break;//left
				case 3: xIncre = -1; break;//up
			}

			//now we scan the whole row/column
			for(int i=0; i<thisLength;i++)
				System.out.print(nums[x+(i+1)*xIncre][y+(i+1)*yIncre]+" ");//pay attention to the index settings

			//after processing this particular row/column
			x = x+thisLength*xIncre;//we set the currentFocus to last element
			y = y+thisLength*yIncre;
